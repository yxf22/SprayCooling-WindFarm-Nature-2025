This repository contains the simulation files and data for the manuscript submitted to Nature.
## ðŸš€ Quick Start for Reviewers (Recommended)

**The fastest way to review our core findings is to inspect the analysis results directly.**

1.  **Open the Case & Data File:**
    - Navigate to the `Simulation_Files/` directory.
    - Open `Reviewer_Ready_Case.cas` (and `Reviewer_Ready_Case.dat`) in ANSYS Fluent 18.0.
    - **Importantï¼š** The `.dat` file contains the full solution field. Upon opening, you should immediately see the velocity and temperature fields presented in Figure 3 of the manuscript.

2.  **What to Look For:**
    - You can now freely explore the pre-computed flow field.
    - Generate streamlines, contour plots, or plots of variables at specific locations to verify the results described in the paper.
    - The expected output, as shown in the paper, is already visible in the solution domain.
